<h5>Flowchart Chosen</h5>
<p>The flowchart we have chosen to use for our story board is this one. We chose
  this flow chart because it includes the main tabs needed for easy navigation
  on the website. We decided to use popular products, about us, best sellers, and
  local benefits as the tabs on the home page. After them, we wanted to put some
  popular products on the home page for show. For example we listed Ferrari as a
  possible choice.

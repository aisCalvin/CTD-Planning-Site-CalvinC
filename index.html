<h1>Designing a Perfume and Cosmetics Website</h1>
<ul>

  <li><a href="homepage_creation.html">Making my homepage</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The website name is www.Mizspa.com. The purpose of this website is to allow female customers (mostly from ages 20-40) to be able
to easily browse and purchase cosmetics. We can design a website that might lure more female customers by creating a more professional
design for the website. We will meet the current web designer of Mizspa and discuss how he wants his website to look more like.
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>The audience that Mizspa.com targets is mainly women from ages 20 to 40 from Australia or Hong Kong.
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>Our objectives of this web design is to be able to contruct a website that is easy to navigate.
We want the website to be able to attract more customers and other business potentials.
Since the owners of the company want a website that doesn't give a "local feel" to it, we are going to
build a new website from scratch that looks professional and legit. We want to try to design the website to look like
a popular cosmetics brand like Dior or L'Or√©al. We also want the customers to see that Mizspa's products are "high and luxury products
at reasonable prices". In addition to the reasonable prices for products, we want to try to emphasize their free shipping and free
giftwrapping services.
</p>
<h4>Success Criteria</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Website is easy to navigate and use.
    <li>Website design is more professional than the previous website.
      <li>Website looks trustable and attracts customers.
      </li>

<h5>Flowchart Chosen</h5>
<p>The flowchart we have chosen to use for our story board is this one. We chose
  this flow chart because it includes the main tabs needed for easy navigation
  on the website. We decided to use popular products, about us, best sellers, and
  local benefits as the tabs on the home page. After them, we wanted to put some
  popular products on the home page for show. For example we listed Ferrari as a
  possible choice.

<h6>Meeting the Client</h6>
<p>Since we needed more information on the website, we decided to meet with the current web designer of
Mizspa. We arranged a meeting with the web designer, and met him at Lai Chi Kok, Hong Kong. During our
discussion of the website, he stated that he wanted the website to show different things on the home page.
So he wanted a slideshow of different products playing. The web designer was open to changing the Mizspa logo.
He also stated that he wants the website to be up and running, especially locally. Finally, he also wants the
website to get more traffic.</p>
<h7>Planning what to do for the Website</h7>
<p>After discussing the web designer of Mizspa, and getting our objectives clear, we decided to first make a flowchart
  for what to include in the home page. We decided to put four tabs. The four tabs include Best Sellers, Local Benefits,
  About Us, and Popular Products. We chose these four because we thought that the customers visiting the website would
  be more interested at the products, who we are, and what they can get extra off the purchases they made from the website.
  We wanted to keep the home page plain and simple with the company's logo somewhere in the corner, and have a automatic slideshow
  that displays popular or new products. We will also put a list of the popular brand's websites.</p>
  <div>
  <h8>Making the Website</h8>
  <p>Firstly, we made a trello board to put down the important parts of making the website.

  After, we worked on designing a couple of wireframe ideas for the website using Adobe Fireworks. This is the first wireframe idea.

<h5>Working with Fireworks Pros and Cons</h5>
<ul>Pros
  <li>Fireworks' slice tool is simple to use when making my story board
    for my homepage
    <li>Fireworks and all its tools are easy to learn and is useful for making
      my homepage. For example, I can use easily use arrows and text boxes to
      label each part of the home page.
    </ul>
    <ul>Cons
      <li>Despite the tools of Fireworks being simple and easy to use, the tools
        are very limited in making a more professional homepage. For example, it
        takes longer to create difficult designs.
        <li> Fireworks only allows someone to create a design, not anything else
          like coding.
        </li>

<h7>Working with Dreamweaver Pros and Cons</h7>
<ul>Pros</ul>
<li>Dreamweaver has the ability to produce accurate and detailed designs that Fireworks can't.
  For example, in Dreamweaver, there is coding. This means that the user can use HTML and CSS to
  design the product they want exactly.
  <li>Dreamweaver's coding has different highlights for different codes, so it is easier to tell which
    code is which.
    <li>You can split your screen in Dreamweaver. This means that you can see your coding and your design
      at the same time. This is really usefull because you can see what your code does to your design quickly.
      <ul>Cons</ul>
      <li>A con for Dreamweaver is how it looks. For example, if you are new to Dreamweaver, it looks really
        confusing.
      </li>
<h8>Subpages</h8>
<p>We decided to use only four subpages on the main website. Those four subpages are "Local Products","Popular Products","About us/Contact us"
  and "Local Benefits". We chose these four subpages because it was the four subpages that had lots of information on the original website.

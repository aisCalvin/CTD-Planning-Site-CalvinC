<h4>Working with Fireworks Pros and Cons</h4>
<ul>Pros
  <li>Fireworks' slice tool is simple to use when making my story board
    for my homepage
    <li>Fireworks and all its tools are easy to learn and is useful for making
      my homepage. For example, I can use easily use arrows and text boxes to
      label each part of the home page.
    </ul>
    <ul>Cons
      <li>Despite the tools of Fireworks being simple and easy to use, the tools
        are very limited in making a more professional homepage. For example, it
        takes longer to create difficult designs.
        <li> Fireworks only allows someone to create a design, not anything else.
